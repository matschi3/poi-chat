This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project for my personal development in webDev. Initially I wanted to build a more complex API and work with it. A few thoughts later, POI-Chat was born and is growing in every free minute I can spend on it. I learn best from projects that push my limits.

POI Chat is designed to help you find a playground or sports field near your location. You can use this place to meet and chat with like-minded people to play and do sports. more on this soon

Currently under development. More on this shortly
